# Flick the Football Simulator
A text-based football simulator I made in high school using python. 

You can choose your team and play a quick match, and the program will simulate match like events until the penalties if it has to ,
Or you can play it with 1-4 friends at your house as it simulates a 4 team knockout tournement with only one victor.
